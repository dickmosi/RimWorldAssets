# Recreated RimWorld Assets
You are welcome to you these in your RimWorld modding efforts, I'm not too bothered about recieving credit.

These are often made for my mod thumbnails, or scrapped mod ideas. These assets are based on Ludeon Studios work. If you use them in your game, Ludeon Studios will send a hit squad after you and will turn you into a cowboy hat IRL.
